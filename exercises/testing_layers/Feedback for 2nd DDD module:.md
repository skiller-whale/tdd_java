# Feedback for 2nd DDD module

Started at 12:05 - 13:08

## Dave's Thoughts

I'm interested in how Kay asks questions to learners individually by name.
Some learners have hated this in the past (particularly in US / Eastern Europe), and some coaches are very uncomfortable doing it (I usually don't do this I'm very confident it will go down well because someone has already spoken a lot).
It felt very effective for getting people involved and for moving the session along.

We should have "reveal to learner" callout types where the coach gets to decide when to show things to learners.

## Feedback Notes

### Introduction

* Intro question can't rely on people having attended previous sessions.
* coding referred to as "this will come in the next session" - we can't guarantee that this session will be next, or even taken.

### A Bad Domain Model

* Question very open-ended, didn't necessarily feel like I knew what the expected answer was.
* We have an additional notes section that is not quite implemented yet, but will show up like instructor notes in the session, and allow learners to see the notes after the session.

### Domain Modelling

* Perhaps make clearer why DDD is costly & why it's only worth doing for the essential parts of a domain. (could be in instructor notes at least).
  * E.g. is this because the less core parts are less likely to have important changes? Or they are more likely to be understood by the team? Less likely to be understood well by domain experts?

### Gathering the Group

### Domain Events

### Domain Events Again

* Perhaps a brief explanation of why we write events in the past tense. This could come from Rachael's explanation.
* Stickies (?) I've never heard this term. Is it the American term for post-it notes?

### Detailing Events

* The language 'Methodical process' made me think of a more prescriptive approach: "ask A, then B, then C" than the reality.
  * Post-it types are the scaffolding to ask questions rather than "ask these specific questions".

### Ubiquitous Language

### Bounded Contexts

* How should we specify the boundaries / shared definitions going forwards. Perhaps worth emphasising that e.g. the code should be refactored / names changed etc.
* Is there anything else we should do to enforce shared definitions etc. Maybe worth something here.
* Are there any signs to look out for that the boundaries are wrong / need to be changed?
